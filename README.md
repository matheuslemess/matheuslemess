### 🧩 [Internal Portal of SEFAZ-MS](https://portal-cotin.ms.gov.br/workspace/home)

I worked as a front-end developer in the creation of the workspace for the employees of the IT Coordination (COTIN) at SEFAZ-MS, using **React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and Chakra UI**.

**Main contributions:**
- Developed a **reusable component library** that standardized the interface and sped up the development of new features.
- Implemented a **drag-and-drop layout** customization feature for widgets, allowing users to personalize their workspace.
- Created an **interactive tutorial using the `react-joyride` library** to guide new users through the portal's main features.
- Built a **real-time notification system** and integrated calendar and email features, centralizing team communication.
- Integrated with back-end APIs to manage events, news, and other resources, ensuring efficient data communication.

**🟢 Result:** The portal became the main internal communication tool, optimizing access to information and boosting employee productivity.
